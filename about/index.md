Hello! My name is Richard. I currently live in Seattle and work as a software engineer. In the past, I have lived in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Toronto, Vancouver, and Beijing.

Some activities I enjoy are [coding,](https://github.com/rzsun) [photography,](/photoportfolio/) and [blogging.](/) I once was also a [hip hop dancer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPw4wmxe-PQ) in a different lifetime.

Feel free to connect with me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhengyusun) if you want to chat.
