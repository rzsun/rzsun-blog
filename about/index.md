Hello! My name is Richard Sun or 孙正宇 (Zheng Yu SUN). I currently live in New York City and work as a software engineer. Prior to NYC, I have lived in Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco, Toronto, Vancouver, and Beijing, and Jingzhou.

I've previously worked at Snap Inc. on data infrastructure and developer tools, and Microsoft on data center orchestration infrastructure.

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhengyusun) if you want to chat or check out my code at [GitHub](https://github.com/rzsun).
