Hello! My name is Richard Sun or 孙正宇 (Zheng Yu SUN). I currently live in New York City and work as a software engineer. Prior to NYC, I have lived in Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco, Toronto, Vancouver, 北京, and 荆州.

I've previously worked at Snap Inc. on data infrastructure and developer tools, and at Microsoft on data center orchestration infrastructure.
