Hello! My name is Richard Sun or 孙正宇（Zheng Yu SUN）. I currently live in New York City and work as a software engineer. In the past, I have lived in Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco, Toronto, Vancouver, and Beijing.

Some activities I enjoy are [coding,](https://github.com/rzsun) [photography,](/photos/) and [blogging.](/) I once was also a [hip hop dancer](https://youtu.be/ixXp1PBONgc) in a different lifetime.
